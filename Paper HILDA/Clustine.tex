\begin{abstract} 
    Any data management system needs to work together with people, whose needs
    determine the goals for the system, and who must provide the input and who
    need to work effectively with the output. Data management systems will work
    much better when they take account of the cognitive and physiological
    characteristics of the people involved. Recent technology trends (such as
    touch screens, motion detection, and voice recognition) are widening the
    possibilities for users to interact with systems, and many
    information-provision industries are shifting to personalized processing to
    better target their services to the usersâ€™ wishes. HILDA is a new workshop
    that will allow researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and results
    relating to how data management can be done with awareness of the people
    who form part of the processes.
