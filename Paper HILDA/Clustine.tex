\begin{abstract} 
Given the recent advances of AI and the stellar popularity of messaging apps
(e.g., WhatsApp), conversational engines are no longer seen as quirky artifacts
of customer support services and computer science museums. Chatbots provide a
mighty, lightweight and accessible way to propose services over the Internet.
In this paper, we introduce Clustine, a system designed to help users query
large tables through short messages. The main idea is to combine cluster
analysis and text generation to compress the query results, describe then with
natural language and make recommendations. We detail the architecture of our
system, demonstrate it with two use cases, and present early experiments with
10 real datasets to show that its promises are reachable.
